Hi there, welcome to this little corner of the cyber world!

![image]({{ "/assets/img/about.jpg" | relative_url }}){: width="360" .rounded .shadow .d-block .mx-auto }

My name is Chu Duc Anh — you can call me by my surname **`Chử`** or **`anhcd`** for short. I'm a third-year student majoring in Information Security at PTIT (Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology), Vietnam.

Currently, I'm most interested in web exploitation. I actively participate in CTF competitions as part of my team, **PTIT.Lugia**. I usually take on web, forensics, crypto challenges — but to be honest, I always hope to just do web 😄

This blog is where I document my learning journey — whether it’s CTF write-ups, deep dives into specific CVEs, or notes on technical topics I’m currently exploring. Writing helps me learn better, and I hope some of my posts might help you too!

Btw, you can find **[more of my post here](https://github.com/anhcd05)**
